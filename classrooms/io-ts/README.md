# Intro to `io-ts`

Welcome to the Intro to `io-ts` classroom! In this classroom, you'll learn about
[`io-ts`](https://gcanti.github.io/io-ts/), a runtime type system for IO
decoding/encoding.

## Overview

This classroom is designed to give you a basic understanding of `io-ts` and how
to use it in your TypeScript projects. By the end of the classroom, you'll be
able to:

- Understand the basic principles of runtime type checking with `io-ts`
- Use `io-ts` to decode and encode JSON data
- Define your own custom types using `io-ts`

## Getting Started

To get started with this classroom, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `classrooms/io-ts` directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. To launch the tests in watch mode, run `npm start`.
5. Open the `./index.ts` and follow the instructions.

The tests will run and show the results in your terminal. You'll be able to see
which tests passed and which failed. Follow the instructions in each exercise to
complete the exercises and test your understanding of `io-ts`.
