# Godu Academy

Welcome to the Godu Academy ! This repository contains a series of classrooms
that will help you learn and practice important concepts in TypeScript
programming, as well as functional programming.

## Overview

This repository is divided into multiple GitHub classrooms, each covering a
different topic in TypeScript programming. The following are the classrooms that
are currently available:

- [Intro to `io-ts`](./classrooms//io-ts/README.md): Learn about
[`io-ts`](https://gcanti.github.io/io-ts/), a runtime type system for IO
decoding/encoding.

Each classroom contains a set of exercises that will help you practice the
concepts covered in the classroom. You can complete the exercises directly in
the classroom, and you can also clone the repository and work on the exercises
locally.

## Prerequisites

To complete the exercises in this repository, you will need:

- A basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, functions,
and control structures.
- Experience with TypeScript is helpful but not required.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply navigate to the GitHub classroom
that you are interested in, and follow the instructions in the README. The
README for each classroom will contain detailed instructions on how to complete
the exercises and submit your work.
